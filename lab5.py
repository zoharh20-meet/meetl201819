# Create a variable representing the traveler's

#Problem 3

# Write a simple class that defines a person
# with attributes of first_name, last_name

# 80-89	B
# 70-79	C
# 60-69	D
# 0-59	F

# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student iis failing.
